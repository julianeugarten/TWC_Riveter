# TWC: Using Riveter to Map Gendered Power Dynamics in Hades/Persephone Fanfiction 

This repository contains supplementary code and data for the paper 'Using Riveter to Map Gendered Power Dynamics in Hades/Persephone Fanfiction ' which is forthcoming in _Transformative Works and Cultures._ 

Specifically, it contains:
- Two pickled Riveter-models, one using the agency-lexicon and one using the power-lexicon, for a dataset of fanfiction about Hades and Persephone from [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/). The models were redacted so they no longer contain the fanfiction texts themselves.
- One Jupyter Notebook you can use to explore the models. Note that you need to install Riveter to be able to run this notebook. [You can find the code on Github here](https://github.com/maartensap/riveter-nlp). 


The power- and agency-lexicons were created by Sap et al. [Read more about these lexicons here](https://aclanthology.org/D17-1247/).  

Riveter was created by Antoniak et al. [Read more about Riveter here](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-demo.36/).
